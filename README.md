# Waterfalls
This is a roguelike game using ruby programming language built during the Academy PGH program.

Right now in the middle of making this a vanilla JavaScript program. This is to adjust some things, making the shark move asychronous to the boat moving. Also will be easier to deploy to a website.

TO-DO List:
* ~~Add a health system & bar~~
* ~~Scrollable screen~~
* ~~Make fog of war/lighted area~~
* ~~Make is is the movement of the shark is not built upon the movement of the boat(Asynchronous? Multi-Threading? Something Else?)~~ (solved this through an interval timer, which seems very obvious now)
* Make shark it's own class so that there may be several of them
* Add pirate ships that shoot projectiles
* Add upgrades for boats i.e. sails to make boat go faster, weapons, armor
* Multiple levels
* Money system
* ~~Game Over Screen -- this exists in theory, but it's not current working, showing and staying up when game should be over.~~ (This partially exists, if you hit another button it doesn't work)
* Start game screen/Option so that a game might be started/restarted


Known Bugs:
* ~~Shark phases through boat sometimes~~
* ~~Game doesn't exit after eaten by shark~~(Irrelavent now because of health system)
