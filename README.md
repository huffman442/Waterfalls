# Waterfalls
This is a roguelike game using ruby programming language built during the Academy PGH program.

Right now in the middle of making this a vanilla JavaScript program. This is to adjust some things, making the shark move asychronous to the boat moving. Also will be easier to deploy to a website.

TO-DO List:
* Add a health system & bar
* Add pirate ships that shoot projectiles
* Make is is the movement of the shark is not built upon the movement of the boat(Asynchronous? Multi-Threading? Something Else?)
* Make shark it's own class so that there may be several of them
* Make fog of war/lighted area
* Add upgrades for boats i.e. sails to make boat go faster, weapons, armor
* Multiple levels
* Money system
* Game Over Screen

Known Bugs:
* Shark phases through boat sometimes
* Game doesn't exit after eaten by shark
